  Starting in July of 2023, New Yorkers and tourists alike will be able to take a high-speed boat tour of the Hudson River along the Harlem and Upper Manhattan waterfront. The inauguration of the new boat tours, which will launch from the West Harlem Piers, marks the beginning of a project that had been originally scheduled for before the pandemic.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The new Harlem Rocket Tour is the first of three new attractions planned for the 125th St. West Harlem Piers as part of the Harlem Gateway Waterfront Initiative. The initiative, led by Paradise Express Ferry, is New York City’s only Black-owned maritime enterprise. For now, the Harlem Rocket Tours is the only approved part of the three-part plan. The other two parts—a ferris wheel and a museum centered on Harlem’s maritime history—are still in conceptual stages.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The boat tours are set to cast off from a dock currently occupied by the Baylander Steel Beach restaurant. Both the Baylander restaurant and the Harlem Rocket Tours will lease the usage of the pier from the city, which currently owns it.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The tours, which will operate on a 93-passenger high-speed boat, will run along the Harlem and Upper Manhattan waterfront multiple times throughout the day. The Harlem Rocket Tours website also mentions that the tours will be “integrated with novel drone, AI, and cloud-storage technologies.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Michael Trenk, the owner of the Baylander, said he welcomes the new attractions.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I always have a saying: business permeates business,” Trenk said. “More people would go by my boat after they go on the Harlem Rocket, might want a refreshing drink after they’ve been on the Hudson.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Garry Johnson, the CEO of Paradise Express Ferry, noted that he had been in contact with other local businesses, including the owner of the famed Dinosaur Bar-B-Que, regarding the new tours. He said he was excited about the increased business the tours will bring. For Johnson, the new attractions are a way to “level the playing field.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We view this in the lens of economic development as a complement to some of the other efforts that have gone on, and particularly in light of waterfront economic development,” Johnson said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Johnson noted that ferry operations similar to the Harlem Rocket Tours generally increase the value of communities that live on the waterfront by 8 to 10 percent.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Even with the proposed economic benefits, some West Harlem residents, like Joy Gramolini, worry about the high speed of the rocket tours.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I have no problem with an ordinary tiny boat tour, that’s fine,” Gramolini said. “But something else that’s going fast and shooting up that river, I’m not so sure about that.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Trenk noted, however, that the tours would only operate at limited times of the day.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “The Rocket would be a certain amount of hours…” Trenk said. “We’re not really creating this nighttime [scene].”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Lonnie Portis, an environmental policy and advocacy coordinator at WE ACT for Environmental Justice, notes that while noise pollution could be a concern, the new tours mostly commercialize a space that is currently public.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It’s like owning privatized access to waterfront, and we think that the community should have access to that,” Portis said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Johnson also noted that the new tours will be made financially accessible to the community through different discounts.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “The pricing is similar to some of the tours that are downtown,” Johnson said. “The difference is that we’re offering senior discounts, we’re offering children discounts, we’re offering discounts to people who live in a certain community.”
</p>
