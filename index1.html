  The 135th Street Marine Transfer Station on the Hudson River has been unused since its closure in 1999. Now, Paradise Express Ferry, the company bringing the Harlem Rocket boat tours to the 125th Street piers this summer, imagines renovating the run-down facility into a new Harlem Maritime Technology Center and Museum.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Garry Johnson, founder and CEO of Paradise Express Ferry, presented this proposal at the Feb. 1 Community Board 9 landmarks, preservation, and parks meeting. The vision was first revealed in a Jan. 24 Patch article, which sparked online discussion and controversy regarding the potential new attractions.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Opened in 1955, the 28,000 square foot 135th Street Marine Transfer Station of the New York City Department of Sanitation was used to process over 1,000 tons of the city’s residential and commercial garbage per day.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “The 135th Street Transfer Station was closed in 1999 as part of the planned closure of the Fresh Kills Landfill,” DSNY press secretary Vincent Gragnani wrote in a statement to Spectator. “It was not reactivated as part of the 2006 Solid Waste Management Plan. The structure, which is more than five decades old, is in poor condition, and any future use would require substantial rehabilitation or full-scale replacement. While we currently do not have redevelopment plans, we appreciate the input of community stakeholders regarding the future of this facility.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The 24-hour waste center directly polluted the West Harlem area with exhaust, noise, and odors. Lonnie Portis, an environmental policy and advocacy coordinator at WE ACT for Environmental Justice, described the harmful, racially and socially inequitable health and environment effects of the 135th Street Marine Transfer Station on the West Harlem community, which aggravated the negative effects of the local bus depot and the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “[It] exposed the community to … the odors, the constant noise in that area,” Portis said. “It was like a dumping ground for all sorts of hazardous waste and abandoned debris, and residents were exposed to even further harmful toxic substances and conditions.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  After the 135th Street MTS’s 1999 closure, the adjacent Hudson River waterfront from 125th Street to 135th Street was developed and opened in 2009 as the West Harlem Piers Park—yet the dilapidated 135th Street MTS remains unused.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It’s a maritime structure,” Johnson said of the 135th Street MTS. “So why not convert it into a maritime museum?”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In his presentation to CB9 earlier this month, Johnson explained that Paradise Express Ferry hopes to gain city and state approval to transform the 135th Street MTS into the first national maritime museum to showcase the maritime contributions of people of color.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “There’s a whole host of history that our community is just not aware of,” Johnson said. “People in the maritime world are [aware] to some extent, but it’s never been documented in one place. And that’s what we think: a rich history deserves to be on the waterfront in the nation’s most historic and internationally known African American community.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  West Harlem Piers Park goer Cassandra Robinson had never heard of Harlem’s maritime history, but she said, “We need to get the word out more.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Between 1903 and 1941, 125th Street had a working waterfront with a ferry terminal which shuttled passengers between Harlem and New Jersey. Johnson believes that the museum could also highlight the stories of historic Black maritime figures, such as Crispus Attucks, a sailor who was the first casualty in the Revolutionary War; Doris Miller, a Navy sailor who shot at Japanese planes at Pearl Harbor; and Matthew Henson, the first person of color to reach the North Pole.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Brian Wilson, another park enjoyer, had also never heard of Harlem's maritime past, saying, “I didn’t know nothing about that.” Still, he thought, “That museum would be good.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Over the past 20 years, numerous other proposals for the use of the 135th Street MTS have been made, including an aquaculture farm, hydroponics and mulching center, sailing school, and trade show and exhibition space for local artists and vendors. Portis from WEACT does not oppose the concept of a museum in the 135th Street MTS, but thinks that previous proposals for the renovation of the 135th Street MTS should still be considered.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “The community has already gotten together and already decided and had the vision already,” Portis said. “For [the 135th Street MTS], why not explore these visions before we look into these other options as well?”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Paradise Express Ferry projected that the museum would attract 60,000 visitors per year.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Cassandra Robinson also highlighted that in addition to providing more attractions, the projects would also increase local revenue and create more jobs for nearby residents.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We’ve got hard working people right here,” Robinson said. “And they need good jobs.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In addition to the economic benefits, the museum’s pier could also act as a rest office for US Coast Guard or NYPD Harbor Police and an emergency maritime command center for the NYC/USCG during natural disasters.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The museum would also host maritime training facilities, opening up new career opportunities to people in New York City, especially those in offshore wind, which Johnson calls an up-and-coming industry.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Part of the reason for building out this museum is it also becomes a workforce development training site to get people of color into the maritime community and into offshore wind which is the next big industry,” Johnson said. “We need to train this community so that they can participate in this industry that is just beginning, but is 20 years into maturity in Europe. In Europe, there are 20,000 offshore wind turbines. In the United States there are seven.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Paradise Express Ferry hopes to open the doors of the Harlem Maritime Technology Center and Museum in 2027 or 2028. Right now, however, Johnson stresses that the plans for the Museum are still in its early conceptual stages.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “The museum and the [ferris] wheel are proposed concepts. We don’t have permission for that. There hasn't been a process that we've gone through with the city to acquire this structure or to build that pier or whatever the case may be,” Johnson said. “But why not?”
